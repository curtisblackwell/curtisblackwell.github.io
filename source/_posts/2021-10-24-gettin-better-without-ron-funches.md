A little over 2 months ago, I admitted to myself that I'm burnt out. That I've been burnt out for a long time, maybe even several years.

I recently ended a month-long leave of absence to start my recovery process. I started re-learning how to be a human. Paying more attention to my overwhelmed senses[^1] and the pains in my body.

I've found that stream-of-consciousness journaling helps me to find peace when I'm feeling overwhelmed. And when I go re-read my thoughts, I often find thoughts I benefit from diving deeper into and organizing. I find little nuggets o' wisdom that help me make more intentional/strategic decisions about what I want to do. I'm starting to recognize more personal agency and feel less like life is happening to me.

So, inspired by [people I admire and receive "anonymous mentorship" from](Inspiring%20People.md), I decided to start publishing some of what I'm learning and thinking about. I hope my writing helps others, similar to how theirs helps me.

P.S.  
I love me some Ron Funches and recently discovered his podcast, [Gettin' Better with Ron Funches](https://ronfunches.com/gettin-better). Just thought it would be a funny name for this. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
