![Excerpt from my handwritten journal, content below image](/assets/img/evolution-of-values.jpg)

Who/what do my values serve? ➡️ I want to start considering the _impact at scale_ my values have.

Does my vegetarianism matter, for example?

It <mark class="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-300 to-purple-50">complicates</mark> my life, but doesn't really have much of an impact. There aren't several other people eating vegetarian because I am. It just makes it harder to find restaurants to eat at with friends or work colleagues. The best I can tell, is that it forces others to see how difficult it can be to find viable vegetarian options.

  <p>Harder to do things with others. To eat at restaurants. To try things like a keto diet.</p>

Similarly(?) I've never pursued wealth, because I don't really value it. But I do value <mark class="bg-gradient-to-r from-rose-300 to-rose-50">freedom</mark>. I think I want to try and get rich so I can feel secure in <mark class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-300 to-blue-50">doing what I want when I want</mark>.

  <p>Dictating what I spend my time and energy on.</p>
  
  <p>Feeling like I drive my work rather than my work drives me.</p>
  
  <p>Over 50% of my available time is spent working for a <mark class="bg-gradient-to-r from-rose-400">company</mark>, but I don't value the work I'm doing.</p>

  <p>Today I looked at the Teenage Engineering website. I want to buy some <mark class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400">Pocket Operators and modular synths</mark> to play with. But I know I wouldn't use them since I rarely have the energy <mark class="bg-gradient-to-r from-emerald-300">when priorities would align</mark>.</p>

    <p>Or the Mayku Multiplier. This could lead to more fulfilling work and an environment better designed for me. And maybe even creating work for others / helping people escape poverty.</p>

  <aside class="p-4 text-sm bg-gradient-to-r from-emerald-300">
    <p>I also have relationships I care about. The time I <em>could</em> spend playing with them is before/after work, but then my energy is low or the environment isn't conducive.</p>
