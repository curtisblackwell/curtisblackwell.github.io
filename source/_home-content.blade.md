# Hi, my name's **Curtis Blackwell** and I like üêê goats üêê. {.font-normal}

I also build software for the web and got started in 2007. Now-simple tasks like adding drop shadows looked a lot different back then. It meant we had to create images in Photoshop then slice, export, and `background-repeat` 1px √ó ~10px PNGs for each side and corner back then. No fancy `box-shadow` luxury for us in the twilight years of that saucy HTML4 + CSS2 gloss.

Lately I've taken on more leadership roles in my work. Since joining [Highland](http://highlandsolutions.com) in January 2018, I:

- got an established dev team to learn and embrace [Laravel's](https://laravel.com) and [Vue's](https://vuejs.org) conventions,
- created [a framework for collaboratively defining development standards](https://github.com/HighlandSolutions/development-standards),
- organized a biweekly, all-dev meeting where we conspire to make our work better,
- mentored other developers,
- led a team in using [*Shape Up*](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook) to unanimous delight,
- supported my product manager in her work using [*Thinking in Services*](https://www.bispublishers.com/thinking-in-services.html) to uncover and solve for gaps in a complex project (I'm convinced *Thinking in Services* is the next big thing in strategy and service design), and
- helped co-workers get a DEI working group off the ground (and kept it alive after they took new jobs elsewhere).

A unique blend of empathy, insightful criticism, a low tolerance for unpleasant working experiences, and the tenacity to improve my environment and the surrounding ecosystem make me an invaluable team member.

Outside of work, I enjoy casual and strategy gaming, listening to and making music, mixing and drinking cocktails, and going for meandering walks with my partner.
