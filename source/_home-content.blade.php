        I'm a software engineer and manager.
        I aim to maintain a sustainable state&nbsp;of:
    </p>

    <ul title="These be my career goals.">
        <li>producing high-quality, life-improving&nbsp;work;</li>
        <li>advancing my knowledge and&nbsp;skills;</li>
        <li>leaving things better than I found them;&nbsp;and</li>
        <li>encouraging others to do the&nbsp;same.</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    I live for work that provides <strong>social benefit</strong> and revolves around
    <strong>refining&nbsp;operations</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    A recent project serves as a perfect example: The <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>
    app tracks inventories for a refugee-employing company, helping it operate
    <span title="Yes.">smoothlier</span>.&nbsp;<span class="hashtag" title="#hashtag">#2017&nbsp;#april</span>
</p>

<p>It helps the&nbsp;company:</p>

<ul>
    <li>import product data from a Shopify&nbsp;store,</li>
    <li>
        assign a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials">bill&nbsp;of&nbsp;materials</a> to
        each product,&nbsp;and
    </li>
    <li>
        create and fulfill
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_order">production&nbsp;orders</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    These features work together to automate changes where possible, like in products' and
    materials' stocks. The app also sends/receives updates to/from Shopify when&nbsp;appropriate.
</p>

<p>
    In the past, I worked on a coworking space's
    <span title="Statamic v1 for the curious">CMS</span>-powered member/admin dashboard. I planned
    and built features&nbsp;to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        manage members' Stripe subscriptions across multiple Stripe accounts
        (one&nbsp;per&nbsp;location),
    </li>
    <li>send all Stripe transactions to multiple Xero accounts (one&nbsp;per&nbsp;location),</li>
    <li>
        allow members to print via Google Cloud Print, charging per-page after using monthly
        credit,&nbsp;and
    </li>
    <li>help staff manage guest tours and send half-canned/half-fresh follow-up&nbsp;emails.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, there's not much to say beyond, "I'm more than competent." I
    like Vue and&nbsp;Sass. <span title="¯\_(ツ)_/¯">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span>
</p>

<p>
    In general, I like to try and keep code as DRY as possible (like
    <span title="ㅠㅠ">Thomas Jerome Newton's home-planet dry</span>), without wasting time on
    diminishing&nbsp;returns.
</p>

<p>I have other skills and traits that prove useful all the&nbsp;time:</p>

<ul>
    <li>understanding&nbsp;of&nbsp;design</li>
    <li>ability to provide constructive, actionable&nbsp;criticism</li>
    <li>confidence to speak bluntly with the tact to know when to tread&nbsp;softly</li>
</ul>

<p>…and some less&nbsp;often:</p>

<ul>
    <li>mid-level Korean&nbsp;proficiency</li>
    <li>expert&nbsp;chopstickery</li>
    <li>
        <span title="Don't act like you're not impressed.">
            ability to open doorknobbed doors with my&nbsp;foot
        </span>
    </li>
</ul>
