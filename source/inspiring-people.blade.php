            # Inspiring People
            These people inspire me to think about things differently and approach problems smartlier.

            ## Software development
            - [Eva PenzeyMoog](https://twitter.com/epenzeymoog) radiates empathy and wrote the book on [Designing for Safety](https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-safety).
            - [Chelsea Troy](https://twitter.com/HeyChelseaTroy) teaches software development and surrounding skills. She seems super busy making pretty much everything better.
            - [GeePaw Hill](https://twitter.com/GeePawHill) muses about extracting value through software development faster by taking [Many More Much Smaller Steps](https://www.geepawhill.org/series/many-much-more-smaller-steps/).


            ## General management and career wisdom
            - [Sara Wachter-Boettcher](https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie) writes about organizational resilience through caring for people.
            - [Sherrell Dorsey](https://twitter.com/Sherrell_Dorsey) reframes common thinking in ingenius ways to reveal flaws and better approaches.


            ## Service design? Thinking about systems
            - [Majid Iqbal](https://twitter.com/mxiqbal) wrote a great book called [*Thinking in Services*](https://www.bispublishers.com/thinking-in-services.html). I've barely gotten into it, but it's already changed the ways I think about pretty much every interaction. I just haven't had the time and energy to finish it yet.
            - [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck) is talking a lot about [incentives](https://geekincentives.substack.com) and how we'd be better off thinking through those we intentionally and unintentionally create.


            ## Identifying and interrupting shitty thought patterns and behavior
            - [Em](https://twitter.com/emrazz) is a master of explaining some pretty fucked up patterns of thought and behavior a lot of us (the vast majority of us men) engage in.
            - [Carys](https://twitter.com/blindandb0ujee) talks a lot about accessibility and disability, digital and not.
