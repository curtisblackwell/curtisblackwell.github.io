                    # Hey there fellow human!

                    My name is Curtis Blackwell üêê. I write here about myself, my work, and my hobbies. I intend to focus on my growth and share some journaling excerpts I find interesting.

                    You can expect to find content related to [high sensitivity](https://hsperson.com/), software development, people management, games, music, and thinking about things as systems/engines/I'm-not-great-at-articulating-this-yet. I'll bet a lot of it will be me processing what I learn from [people who inspire me](/inspiring-people).
